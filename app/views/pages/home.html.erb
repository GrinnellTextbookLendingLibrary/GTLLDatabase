  <p>Welcome to the Grinnell Lending Library!</p>
  <p><font size=5>THIS IS IN PROGRESS. It does not represent the contents of
      the Grinnell Textbook Lending Library. Any similarities to books living
      or dead are purely coincidental.</font></p>
  <p>Look for the completed site in May 2013! </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Who are we?</b><p>The Grinnell Textbook Lending Library is a
        student-run library that lends textbooks to students for the
        semester, as well as caps and gowns to graduating seniors. The
        mission of the Library is to defray the high cost of textbooks,
        especially for students who are economically
        disadvantaged.</p> </li>
    <li><b>Where are we?</b><p>We are located in Read Pit (next to the
        kitchen).</p></li>
    <li><b>When are we open?</b><p>(Hours not yet posted for fall 2013
        semester)</p></li>
    <li><b>How do I check out books?</b>
      <p><a href="checkoutProcedure.html">Instructions, procedure, and
      sample checkout form</a></p></li>
    <li><b>What if I don't return my books?</b><p>If you have checked out
        books and not returned them, you will NOT be able to check out more
        books. You may return the books at checkout, but if you forget to return
        even one, you will still be barred. If for some reason you absolutely
        cannot return a book, you must email us and we will find a
        solution. </p></li>
    <li><b>How do I contact you?</b><p>We are available through email at
    [textbooks].</p></li>
