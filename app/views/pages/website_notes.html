Check Out Books

To checkout a book to Some Student:
(1) Find the book's listing, and click 'Checkout'. If there's no Checkout link, this means that there are no available copies of that book.
(3) From the checkout page, select 'Some Student' from the drop-down menu, and click 'Submit'.

Check In Books

To checking books from Some Student:
(1) Go to 'Some Students' Entry page: 'All Users' -> 'Some Student'.
(2) The Entry page will list Some Student's books. Click on 'Checkin' next to each book you wish to check in.

Adding Books

Books records are stored on this website with their title, authors,
edition, and number of copies. As a manager, you may want to 
(1) Add new copies to an existing book record or 
(2) Add a new book record. 

Update the number of copies of a book
Use the 'update copies' form on the book's Entry page. 

Keep in mind:
The number you are adding is the new total number of copies. So, if a book has 5 current copies, and you are adding 2 copies, 
you want to enter 7, not 2.

Add New Books
Use the 'New Book' form (linked to in the main navigation bar.)
Before you add a new book, search for the book to be sure that the book is not already in the database. If it is, just update the number of copies.
